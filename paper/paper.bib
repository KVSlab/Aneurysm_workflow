  abstract = {Although cerebral autoregulation (CA) appears well maintained during
	mild to moderate intensity dynamic exercise in young subjects, it
	is presently unclear how aging influences the regulation of cerebral
	blood flow during physical activity. Therefore, to address this question,
	middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAV), mean arterial pressure
	(MAP), and the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (Pa(CO(2)))
	were assessed at rest and during steady-state cycling at 30\% and
	50\% heart rate reserve (HRR) in 9 young (24 +/- 3 yr; mean +/- SD)
	and 10 older middle-aged (57 +/- 7 yr) subjects. Transfer function
	analysis between changes in MAP and mean MCAV (MCAV(mean)) in the
	low-frequency (LF) range were used to assess dynamic CA. No age-group
	differences were found in Pa(CO(2)) at rest or during cycling. Exercise-induced
	increases in MAP were greater in older subjects, while changes in
	MCAV(mean) were similar between groups. The cerebral vascular conductance
	index (MCAV(mean)/MAP) was not different at rest (young 0.66 +/-
	0.04 cm x s(-1) x mmHg(-1) vs. older 0.67 +/- 0.03 cm x s(-1) x mmHg(-1);
	mean +/- SE) or during 30\% HRR cycling between groups but was reduced
	in older subjects during 50\% HRR cycling (young 0.67 +/- 0.03 cm
	x s(-1) x mmHg(-1) vs. older 0.56 +/- 0.02 cm x s(-1) x mmHg(-1);
	P < 0.05). LF transfer function gain and phase between MAP and MCAV(mean)
	was not different between groups at rest (LF gain: young 0.95 +/-
	0.05 cm x s(-1) x mmHg(-1) vs. older 0.88 +/- 0.06 cm x s(-1) x mmHg(-1);
	P > 0.05) or during exercise (LF gain: young 0.80 +/- 0.05 cm x s(-1)
	x mmHg(-1) vs. older 0.72 +/- 0.07 cm x s(-1) x mmHg(-1) at 50\%
	HRR; P > 0.05). We conclude that despite greater increases in MAP,
	the regulation of MCAV(mean) is well maintained during dynamic exercise
	in healthy older middle-aged subjects.},
