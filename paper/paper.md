# Summary

Cardiovascular diseases are overwhelming the healthcare systems, and the costs are anticipated to increase in the years
to come [@Murray1997], not to the mention the personal tragedy for those affected [@gage1996effect]....

# Statement of Need

A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context
of related work. 

VaMPy is needed...

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }

# Statement of Usage (if applicable)

Mention (if applicable) of any ongoing research projects using the software or recent scholarly publications enabled by
it.
