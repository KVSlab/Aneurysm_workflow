# Summary

Cardiovascular diseases are overwhelming the healthcare systems, and the
costs are anticipated to increase in the years to come [@Murray1997],
not to the mention the personal tragedy for those affected [@gage1996effect].

# Statement of Need

VaMPy is needed...

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }

# Statement of Field / Related Work
