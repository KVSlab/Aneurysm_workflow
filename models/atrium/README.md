# Left atrium model
The provided left atrium model is collected from the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013 [1], spesifically case b003, segmented by INRIA. 

The model meshing and probe points can be computed using automatedPreProcessing with the following command:

```
python automatedPreProcessing/automatedPreProcessing.py -m diameter -i test/Case_test_atrium/atrium.vtp -c 1.3
```

Note: Aneurysm workflow is intended for artery models. Therefore, boundary conditions for other models will be wrong. Adapting to other vascular models, such as the atrium, is work in progress.
